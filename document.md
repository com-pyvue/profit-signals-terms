Such prohibited cases also include creating products or services based on ProfitSignals content any processing of ProfitSignals' content, or any other use cases that undermine the restrictions in place by the Data Providers.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly forbidden not only direct non-display usage by our users but also the development, offering, 
or utilization of any third-party products, tools or services designed to facilitate or enable such non-display usage of ProfitSignals' content and market data. 

For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby explicitly prohibited for any third party to create, offer, or operate any product or service that:

in operations control, risk management programs, or any machine-driven processes excluding direct, human-readable display.
- Claims compatibility with, or advertises the use of, ProfitSignals' features (such as webhooks) for purposes that are explicitly prohibited by ProfitSignals' terms, 
thereby indirectly contributing to violations of ProfitSignals' usage restrictions.

This policy applies equally to all entities, irrespective of whether they are direct users of ProfitSignals' services or third-party service providers.

The provision of features by ProfitSignals, such as webhooks, is intended solely for permissible uses within the scope of display and personal or internal business purposes, as originally defined.

or make use of, ProfitSignals' data, irrespective of their direct engagement with the ProfitSignals platform.

## Disclaimer of warranties

ProfitSignals WEBSITE AND SERVICES AND ALL INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS AND PRODUCTS INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THIS WEBSITE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY ProfitSignals ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. 

ProfitSignals MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THAT ANY OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR SERVICES OR ON ProfitSignals IS ACCURATE, RELIABLE, CURRENT, COMPLETE OR APPROPRIATE FOR YOUR NEEDS. 

ProfitSignals DOES NOT GUARANTEE, REPRESENT, OR WARRANT THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, AND YOU AGREE THAT FROM TIME TO TIME ProfitSignals MAY REMOVE THE SERVICE FOR INDEFINITE PERIODS OF TIME, 
OR CANCEL THE SERVICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS TERMS OF USE. 

ProfitSignals DOES NOT REPRESENT OR GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE FREE FROM LOSS, CORRUPTION, ATTACK, VIRUSES, INTERFERENCE, HACKING, OR OTHER SECURITY INTRUSION, AND ProfitSignals DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY RELATING THERETO. 

ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICE IS ACCESSED AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OR LOSS THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OR USE OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL.

Various information available through our services or on ProfitSignals may be specially obtained by ProfitSignals from professional businesses or organizations, such as exchanges, news providers,
market data providers and other content providers (including established financial exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ and Chicago Mercantile Exchange),
who are believed to be sources of reliable information (collectively, the "Data Providers").
Nevertheless, due to various factors — including the inherent possibility of human and mechanical error — the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, results obtained from use,
and correct sequencing of information available through our services and website are not and cannot be guaranteed by ProfitSignals.
Similarly, we make no warranty and assume no obligation or liability for indicators, ideas, and other third-party content.
Your use of any third-party indicators, ideas and other content is at your sole risk.

### Disclaimer regarding investment decisions and trading

Decisions to buy, sell, hold or trade in securities, commodities and other investments involve risk and are best made based on the advice of qualified financial professionals.

Any trading in securities or other investments involves a risk of substantial losses.

The practice of "Day Trading" involves particularly high risks and can cause you to lose substantial sums of money.

Before undertaking any trading program, you should consult a qualified financial professional.

Please consider carefully whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial condition and ability to bear financial risks.

Under no circumstances shall we be liable for any loss or damage you or anyone else incurs as a result of any trading or investment activity that you or anyone else engages in based on any information or material you receive through ProfitSignals or our services.

### Disclaimer regarding hypothetical performance results

Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are mentioned below.

No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.

In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program.

One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight.

In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading.

For example the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of the trading losses are material points, which can also adversely affect trading results.

There are numerous other factors related to the market in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.

that you actually meet the criteria for a 'Professional' status at any point during or after subscribing to ProfitSignals or to market data from exchanges, you will be liable for the difference between the 'Non-Professional' 
and 'Professional' subscription rates for both ProfitSignals subscription and relevant market data.

This applies retroactively from the date you initiated your subscription. Furthermore, we reserve the right to automatically invoice you for this difference and charge the associated amount to your on-file payment method.

The service is billed in advance monthly. There is no trial period. However, there is a Free plan available for all users, which allows you to try the service without any payment.

All billing is recurring, which means you will continue to get billed until you cancel your subscription. 

You are solely responsible for properly cancelling your ProfitSignals subscription. 

An email request, support ticket, and other means of messaging (like Discord) asking for your subscription to be cancelled is not considered cancellation.

You may cancel your subscription anytime on the User Profile page.

If you cancel the service before your current paid-up period ends, your subscription will remain active until the next due date.

After the due date, if no payment is received, your subscription will be stopped. Your account will be switched to the Free plan, and the limits of that plan will apply.

We don't offer refunds.
